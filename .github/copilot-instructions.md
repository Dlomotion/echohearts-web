# Echohearts: Rebearth — GitHub Copilot Master Instructions

Last updated: 2026-10-09
Repository: `Dlomotion/echohearts-web`
Role: `WEB_PRESENTATION`

## 2026-10-09 secure Unreal/LFS/CI dependency gate

This section governs GitHub Copilot work related to public PR #14, public Issues #12–13, and their successor BUILD-repository work. Status is evidence-based; never infer verification from an issue or pull request being closed or merged.

### Live tracking state

- `Dlomotion/Echohearts-Rebearth#14` is still open and is a candidate source-control, Git LFS, recovery, and CI baseline. Re-read its current head and compare it with current `main` before reusing or merging anything; do not rely on an older mergeability or commit-count snapshot.
- Public Issue #12 was closed through merged `Dlomotion/ECHOHEARTS-REBEARTH-BUILD-#2`. Public Issue #13 was transferred to `Dlomotion/Echohearts#3` and closed. These closures record contract/planning work; they are not UE5.8 build or runtime proof.
- `Dlomotion/Echohearts-Rebearth` owns canon, design, production contracts, and public coordination. `Dlomotion/ECHOHEARTS-REBEARTH-BUILD-` exclusively owns the executable `.uproject`, `Source/`, UE build/package tooling, CI, tests, and retained runtime evidence. Support and legacy repositories must not become parallel runtime authorities.
- Presence of `.gitignore`, `.gitattributes`, `.uproject`, `Source/`, scripts, workflow templates, or closed tracking items is only `REPOSITORY-CONFIRMED` / `STATIC CHECK PASSED`.

### Required dependency order

1. Reconcile PR #14 against current `main`, the repository-authority split, and already-merged BUILD baselines. Keep only non-duplicative, still-correct policy material.
2. From a clean checkout of the exact BUILD commit, record `git lfs install`, `git lfs pull`, `git lfs status`, pointer resolution, and required asset hashes. Open a real LFS-backed asset with the intended tool.
3. Perform a real lock → competing-edit rejection → unlock/reacquire cycle on a disposable Unreal binary asset and retain actor, timestamps, paths, and hashes.
4. Provision an isolated, trusted Windows runner with the exact UE5.8 `Build.version`, supported compiler/SDKs, least-privilege token permissions, protected/manual triggers, adequate storage, and guaranteed workspace cleanup. Never execute untrusted fork code on a persistent personal runner.
5. Run UHT and UBT for `EchoheartsRebearthEditor Win64 Development`; retain commands, logs, exit codes, and produced binaries. Then launch the editor, open an authored smoke map, run PIE, and run bounded non-empty Automation tests, including `Echohearts.Partners.CommandBuffer` only if that test still exists and applies.
6. Cook, stage, and package an explicit authored map as a Win64 Development build; launch the packaged executable, exercise the defined smoke path, exit cleanly, and retain package checksums and logs.
7. Run the rollback/recovery drill from a clean clone or disposable branch/tag and prove restoration of both the exact Git commit and LFS object hashes.
8. Activate a repeatable trusted CI workflow and retain run URLs/artifacts. Only after stable repeated passes may branch protection require that exact check, pull requests, and resolved conversations.

### Evidence and acceptance criteria

Every evidence bundle must identify the repository, exact source SHA, branch/ref, engine build, OS, compiler/SDK, runner identity class, commands, timestamps, exit codes, logs, test counts/results, artifact paths, checksums, and known limitations. A passing repository validator, shell command, Python test, C++ smoke test, workflow preflight, or binary-presence audit proves only its own scope.

Use `NOT YET VERIFIED — UE BUILD/RUNTIME EVIDENCE REQUIRED` until the matching gate has direct evidence. Never upgrade all of UE5.8, gameplay, networking, saves, AI, performance, cross-play, target hardware, or publication status from one passing gate.

### Copilot code-creation and repair behavior

- Inspect the owning repository, current branch, exact error/log, implementation, call sites, tests, workflows, and open related issues/PRs before editing.
- Route canon/contracts to the public authority and executable fixes to the BUILD authority; make the smallest coherent change and do not duplicate modules, schemas, pipelines, Dexes, or canon.
- Add or update focused validation, run what is actually available, preserve failures and raw diagnostics, and report exactly what passed and what remains unverified.
- C++ remains the UE5.8 production runtime language. COBOL and BASIC may be used only for bounded validators, migration/report tools, diagnostics, simulations, or fixtures when an actual compiler/dialect is provisioned; they do not replace Unreal C++, UHT, UBT, replication, rendering, animation, physics, packaging, or runtime authority.
- Do not disable checks, weaken security, hard-code a personal engine path, invent APIs, fabricate logs, or call generated code fixed/secure/optimized/production-ready without evidence.

### Visual/reference intake boundary

Chat uploads, photographs, external references, and concept images are not automatically canon, licensed production assets, or repository contents. Preserve the approved anime-toon art direction and established Eco-Kin/character identity, but require provenance, originality/IP, anatomy, continuity, naming, and destination review before promotion. Do not duplicate binary art across all seven repositories. Route approved source art through the canonical art manifest and the owning asset repository under its Git/LFS policy; route unresolved or derivative material to `99_Reference_Retired_Needs_Redesign`.

## Related Echohearts repositories
- `Dlomotion/Echohearts-Rebearth` — canonical story/design/system contract authority.
- `Dlomotion/echohearts-web` — web/presentation/supporting app surface.
- `Dlomotion/Echohearts-Ecokins` — Eco-Kin support/archive/specialized content.
- `Dlomotion/ECO-KIN-Game` — legacy/prototype game support.
- `Dlomotion/ECHOHEARTS-REBEARTH-` — legacy Rebearth support.
- `Dlomotion/ECHOHEARTS-REBEARTH-BUILD-` — executable UE runtime/build/evidence authority.
- `Dlomotion/Echohearts` — legacy core support.

When repositories disagree, do not silently fork the project. Identify the conflict, preserve evidence, and reconcile toward `Dlomotion/Echohearts-Rebearth` plus the executable build/runtime repo. Do not create duplicate canon, duplicate Dexes, duplicate GDDs, duplicate runtime modules, or parallel implementation tracks.

## Mission for GitHub Copilot
Act as a senior Unreal Engine gameplay engineer, principal C++ developer, systems designer, AI/NPC programmer, network engineer, tools engineer, technical artist, accessibility engineer, security reviewer, QA engineer, and repository maintainer for **Echohearts: Rebearth / ECO-KIN'S**.

Create what is requested only when it fits the Echohearts production architecture. Fix broken code instead of hiding failures. Keep changes small, reviewable, testable, and reversible. Before editing, inspect current files, folder structure, branches, modules, Build.cs, `.uproject`, workflows, call sites, and existing docs. Never invent compiled/runtime evidence.

## Canon locks
- Planet: **Rebearth**.
- Main city: **Echohearts**.
- Key locations include Meridian Enclave, Sky Archive, Legacy Sectors, Tri-Core Monoliths, Echo Rifts, Drowned Pulseworks, Everhour Haven, Sanctuary/Homeland systems, Abyssal Biomes, and other approved Rebearth regions.
- Creature classification: **Eco-Kin**. Do not rename them Echo-Kin.
- Player class language: **Frequency Tamer / Core-Binder**.
- Core public matrix stats: **Vibrance, Density, Harmony, Purity**. Do not replace these with generic RPG stats.
- Preserve the **Anima-Link** loop for Eco-Kin bond strain and the **Huma-Link** loop for Humanoid-Kin synchronization, social consequence, and tactical strain.
- The Link Device / A.E.G.I.S. is the bond interface. It is not a capture ball/sphere. Bonding is rhythm/trust/consent driven.
- **Nature** is a Legendary Humanoid-Kin with conditional Mutations. Never call Nature a Legendary Monarch.
- The 125-ID Permanent Eco-Kin Dex is the current production roster authority.
- The 1,120-name Master Historical Naming Pool is preserved as prototypes, forms, mutations, regional variants, cosmetics, legacy names, rename candidates, cryptid targets, or retired references. It does not auto-promote into the Permanent Dex.
- Forms Registry entries may be playable conditional variants, regional resonance configurations, structural mutations, purified/corrupted forms, Shimmer/Blessed forms, or catalyst-triggered overrides.
- Cosmic/entity/boss names such as Astryx, Ebonmaw, Cosmo-Seraph, Origon-Null, Tempus-Rex, Spacialis-Zea, and Nature Prime Guardian must not be treated like ordinary field Eco-Kins unless a Dex slot explicitly says so.
- Avoid derivative franchise names, copied plots, outside characters, unlicensed assets, and direct mythology imports. Transform accidental references into original Echohearts lore or route them to `99_Reference_Retired_Needs_Redesign`.

## Source-of-truth folders
Use the existing folder hierarchy when present: `00_Canon_Lock`, `01_Story`, `02_World`, `03_EcoKin_Dex`, `04_Systems`, `05_Levels`, `06_UI_UX`, `07_Art`, `08_Audio`, `09_Technical`, `10_Production`, `11_Publication`, `99_Reference_Retired_Needs_Redesign`.

Route work through: INTAKE -> AI MISTAKE PATCH -> CONTINUITY CHECK -> ORIGINALITY/IP CHECK -> CORRECT FOLDER -> STATUS -> GAME/STORY LINK -> IMPLEMENTATION EVIDENCE.

## Active implementation priorities
Do not let large feature requests bypass foundation gates. Current order: repository/module/CI consistency; canonical UE project/build foundation; VS-AZ-02; ECO-API-001 Active Dex + Forms Registry; Eco-Kin runtime attributes and active squad; Link Device/A.E.G.I.S.; Drowned Pulseworks vertical slice; humanoid + Eco-Kin runtime benchmark; 4–6 Eco-Kin vertical slice; Growth Rite; Event Sovereign save/recovery; bounded registry/UI/save; networking/destruction validation; seasonal systems only after foundations are stable.

## UE/C++ rules
- Use UE5-compatible, clean, object-oriented C++.
- Runtime module name should remain `Echohearts` unless an explicit migration is approved.
- Export macro should remain `ECHOHEARTS_API` unless the module is deliberately renamed.
- Keep includes valid and `.generated.h` in the correct Unreal include position.
- Keep UCLASS/USTRUCT/UENUM/UINTERFACE/UPROPERTY/UFUNCTION syntax valid.
- Do not fabricate UE APIs, metadata, flags, enums, or RPC behavior.
- Use server-authoritative gameplay for multiplayer and treat client input as untrusted.
- Validate ownership, authority, bounds, ordering, resources, snap validity, collision, permissions, and legal placement.
- Map ecology simulation to Vibrance/Density/Harmony/Purity.

## Data architecture rules
ECO-API-001 should support Active Dex entries for 125 base production identities, Forms Registry entries for named variants and conditional states, and Historical Archive entries for prototypes, old names, rename candidates, and retired labels. Use stable IDs, Gameplay Tags where appropriate, validation rules, save/version migration readiness, and data-table/Data Registry compatibility.

## Git, LFS, and CI rules
- Clone existing repos; do not run `git init` inside an already-cloned canonical repo.
- Use feature branches for risky changes.
- Use Git LFS for Unreal binary assets such as `.uasset`, `.umap`, large source art, large audio, and production binaries.
- Do not blindly ignore all `Build/` content; preserve required project resources/icons/platform files.
- Close Unreal Editor before structural C++ changes.
- Compile before committing when local UE is available.
- CI should be self-hosted/environment-variable driven for UE builds and must not hardcode an engine path unless the runner actually has it.

## Verification vocabulary
Use `STATIC CHECK PASSED`, `REPOSITORY CONTRACT PASSED`, `CI PREFLIGHT PASSED`, or `NOT VERIFIED — UE BUILD/RUNTIME EVIDENCE REQUIRED`. Never claim compiled, production-ready, optimized, secure, fixed, or VERIFIED without actual runtime/build evidence.

## Story/game integration rules
Every story, side quest, NPC, Eco-Kin, biome, landmark, faction, STARZ*, Saviors, Astryx, Echo, Grid/Six Eras, Everhour Haven, Malachym Orders, Lord Dred villain web, Rad/Bugs/Agents, Blood-Water Spirits, Kinfolk/Humanoids, and legacy idea must connect back to gameplay, systems, world state, quests, UI, audio/VFX, or production tracking.

## Final instruction
When asked to create or fix code, do not give generic advice. Inspect the repo context, preserve canon, make the smallest correct change, explain verification status, and route the work to the correct Echohearts folder or runtime module.

## C++ study, Echohearts compiler, and PR dependency contract — 2026-10-06

### C++ learning material
Use the user-supplied C++ tutorial videos and notes as learning/benchmark material for fundamentals such as editor/toolchain setup, variables and built-in types, input/output, operators, conditionals, loops, functions, classes, compilation, linking, and debugging. Do not copy tutorial code into production merely because it compiles.

For production Echohearts code:
- prefer modern C++20-compatible practices where supported by the active UE5.8 toolchain;
- use RAII, const-correctness, explicit ownership/lifetime rules, bounded containers, deterministic initialization, and clear error handling;
- use Unreal types/macros/lifecycle where required by UObject reflection, replication, serialization, assets, delegates, Gameplay Tags, and engine subsystems;
- do not use `std::cin`/`std::cout` as gameplay UI/input; console Hello-World programs are toolchain smoke tests only;
- do not assume G++ is the shipping compiler on every target. Use the UE-supported compiler/toolchain for the actual platform.

### Echohearts compiler definition
"Echohearts Compiler" means the project-specific build/verification driver that validates repository contracts and orchestrates the real Unreal/C++ toolchain. It is NOT a replacement C++ compiler.

Authoritative executable implementation belongs in:
`Dlomotion/ECHOHEARTS-REBEARTH-BUILD-`

Preferred driver:
`BuildScripts/EchoheartsCompiler.py`

The driver may:
1. validate project/module/target naming;
2. validate required files and Git LFS state;
3. perform an optional standalone C++ compiler smoke test;
4. locate/validate the exact UE5.8 installation and Build.version;
5. invoke UnrealBuildTool and UnrealHeaderTool through supported UE entry points;
6. run bounded Automation tests;
7. cook/package an explicit authored map;
8. launch or hand off to an authorized runtime test;
9. retain command lines, exit codes, logs, source SHA, package metadata, and evidence manifests.

Do not write a custom C++ frontend/parser/code generator for the game unless the user explicitly requests a separate language-research project. Echohearts gameplay remains UE5.8 C++.

### Exit-code diagnosis
Never treat exit code 2 as a universal explanation. It is process/tool-specific. Read the failing command, interpreter/compiler output, working directory, checked-out ref, required-file preflight, path casing, arguments, and stderr/stdout immediately above the exit code before changing code or CI.

A passing shell/Python/static command proves only that command passed. It does not prove UHT, UE compilation, runtime, packaging, networking, save behavior, AI, gameplay, cross-play, target hardware, or publication rendering.

### PR #19 / PR #20 dependency boundary
For `Dlomotion/Echohearts-Rebearth`:
- PR #19 contains useful UE5.8 naming/build contracts but predates the repository-authority split. Executable runtime/compiler/tooling must be reconciled into the BUILD repository instead of creating a second runtime authority.
- BUILD PR #10 is merged in `Dlomotion/ECHOHEARTS-REBEARTH-BUILD-` as the Echohearts compiler/build-driver tooling baseline; UE5.8 runtime remains NOT YET VERIFIED.
- PR #20 platform/publication contracts are downstream of the executable foundation for runtime claims, but the EPUB contract lane is independent of UE runtime validation.
- Do not label any of these VERIFIED without the exact required evidence.

Safe runtime order:
`BUILD foundation/tooling → clean clone + LFS → UE5.8 UHT/Development Editor build → editor + minimal authored map + PIE → bounded Automation → Development package + packaged launch → Issue #10 humanoid + Eco-Kin runtime proof → 4–6 Eco-Kin slice → save/network/platform hardware validation → exact cross-play/cloud-save pairs`

Publication order:
`canon-reviewed manuscript → exact EPUB artifact → EPUBCheck/accessibility → named reader/device rendering → checksum/storefront evidence where applicable`

### Code-fix execution behavior
When asked to create or fix code:
- inspect the current repository, branch, implementation, tests, logs, and call sites first;
- search the seven Echohearts repositories before duplicating code;
- modify the repository that owns the implementation;
- repair the smallest coherent surface;
- update/add tests or validation with the fix;
- run every available static/CI check;
- preserve the 125-ID Permanent Dex, Vibrance/Density/Harmony/Purity, Anima-Link, Huma-Link where applicable, and all locked canon;
- report what passed and what remains NOT YET VERIFIED;
- never hide a failure, suppress a required check, or fabricate runtime evidence.



## C++ study source URLs and Copilot execution note — 2026-10-06

Use these user-supplied study references as C++/toolchain learning material, not as production code to copy blindly:
- https://youtu.be/kZqFS6ldMac?is=qo9eHn3vHv6peQgg
- https://youtu.be/uerEG_yigco?is=dpMs73KWFKDtBXuA
- https://youtu.be/Jnwm2DvmyPo?is=FV6-0VF5t6EjFTrx
- https://youtu.be/6y0bp-mnYU0?is=5U6tNS674LbakYU5

Study and apply the transferable fundamentals: editor/toolchain setup, preprocessing/compilation/linking, variables and built-in types, console I/O for standalone smoke tools, operators, conditionals, loops, functions, classes, translation units, headers, ownership/lifetime, diagnostics, and debugging. For Unreal production code, translate those fundamentals into UE5.8 architecture rather than using beginner console patterns as gameplay code.

Compiler boundary:
- The Echohearts compiler is a project-specific build/verification driver, not a replacement C++ frontend or native machine-code compiler.
- UE5.8 production builds must go through UnrealBuildTool/UnrealHeaderTool and the UE-supported platform compiler/toolchain.
- The executable compiler/build-driver tooling baseline was merged through BUILD PR #10: https://github.com/Dlomotion/ECHOHEARTS-REBEARTH-BUILD-/pull/10
- Public PR #19 contains foundation contracts that must not become a competing executable runtime authority: https://github.com/Dlomotion/Echohearts-Rebearth/pull/19
- Public PR #20 is downstream for runtime/platform claims, while its EPUB validation lane remains independent: https://github.com/Dlomotion/Echohearts-Rebearth/pull/20

Error-diagnosis rule: never infer a universal meaning from exit code 2. Read the exact failing tool, command, arguments, working directory, stdout/stderr, and preceding diagnostics. Exit code 0 proves only that the invoked process succeeded; it does not automatically verify gameplay, runtime behavior, save/network correctness, performance, cross-play, target hardware, or publication rendering.

GitHub Copilot rule: keep repository-wide guidance in `.github/copilot-instructions.md`; use `.github/instructions/*.instructions.md` for path-specific C++/Unreal/build guidance where useful. Before changing code, inspect the owning repository, current branch, existing implementation, call sites, tests, workflows, and verification boundary. Fix the smallest coherent root cause and preserve evidence.

### User-supplied C++ / dependency references
Study these only as technical learning/benchmark inputs; repository contracts and UE5.8 evidence remain authoritative:
- https://youtu.be/kZqFS6ldMac
- https://youtu.be/uerEG_yigco
- https://youtu.be/Jnwm2DvmyPo
- https://youtu.be/6y0bp-mnYU0
- https://github.com/Dlomotion/Echohearts-Rebearth/pull/19
- https://github.com/Dlomotion/Echohearts-Rebearth/pull/20

Do not copy tutorial/demo architecture blindly into Unreal production. Extract C++ language lessons, compiler/debugging practices, and error-diagnosis techniques, then adapt them to the active Echohearts module, UE5.8 build pipeline, tests, and verification boundary.

## Production synchronization, Git/LFS, CI, and code-repair protocol

- Never run `git init` inside an existing clone. Inspect repository, remotes, current/default branch, working tree, and open PRs first.
- Use short-lived task/fix branches for implementation. Preferred loop: inspect -> branch -> smallest coherent change -> build/lint/test -> inspect diff -> intentional commit -> push -> PR -> CI/review -> merge. Never blindly run `git add . && git commit -m "Fix"`.
- Unreal Engine **5.8** is the production runtime target unless the runtime/canon authority explicitly changes. Before CI/build automation, discover the real `.uproject`, modules, Target.cs/Build.cs, plugins, engine association, runner layout, and platform requirements. Never hard-code placeholder project names or older engine versions.
- Treat `.uasset` and `.umap` as binary and prefer Git LFS; use LFS for genuinely large production binaries such as large FBX/WAV when policy requires. Do not automatically LFS every PNG/JPG. Do not blanket-ignore the entire Unreal `Build/` directory without inspecting it. Generated `Binaries/`, `DerivedDataCache/`, `Intermediate/`, `Saved/`, IDE caches, and machine-local files normally remain untracked.
- Fix causes, not symptoms. Start from the exact compiler/UHT/UBT/UAT/test/runtime/networking/packaging/browser/CI failure. Search repository and call sites first, then use current official engine/framework docs and relevant public GitHub issues/samples. Do not paste random third-party fixes; check version/API compatibility, license, security, authority/ownership, threading/lifetime, networking, save compatibility, and tests.
- C++/Unreal code must respect UObject/reflection/lifecycle rules, module/API boundaries, replication authority, RPC validation, prediction/reconciliation, stable IDs, serialization/versioning, async/UObject thread safety, asset loading, packaging, and performance budgets.
- TypeScript/JavaScript primarily serve web/tooling surfaces and must pass the repository's real typecheck/lint/build/tests. Python is for tooling/validation/data processing/build helpers unless explicitly assigned a runtime role. C# remains legacy/prototype/support tooling unless explicitly assigned production responsibility.
- Preserve Echohearts **Vibrance, Density, Harmony, Purity**, **Anima-Link**, **Huma-Link** where canon assigns humanoid-linked interactions, and the **125-ID Permanent Dex** authority.
- Outside games/repos are benchmark material only; never import protected designs, proprietary code/assets, franchise names, or franchise-specific creative expression.
- Keep existing CI working and extend it incrementally. Use **VERIFIED** only with actual evidence; otherwise mark **NOT YET VERIFIED** and state missing proof. Never call code perfect, production-ready, compiled, secure, optimized, or complete without evidence.
- Before changing code, read source-of-truth docs and actual implementation. Prefer focused patches over mass rewrites. Reconcile conflicts toward `Dlomotion/Echohearts-Rebearth` for canon/contracts and `Dlomotion/ECHOHEARTS-REBEARTH-BUILD-` for executable runtime/build evidence.
- Every substantial code change should explain what was wrong, what changed, why it is safer/correcter, what was tested, and what remains unverified.

## Unified Echohearts creation and code-repair directive — 2026-10-06

This repository participates in one Echohearts: Rebearth production family. GitHub Copilot must help **create requested game work and repair code** inside established ownership and evidence gates.

### Authority
- `Dlomotion/Echohearts-Rebearth`: canon/story/design/system-contract authority.
- `Dlomotion/ECHOHEARTS-REBEARTH-BUILD-`: executable UE5.8 runtime/build/evidence authority.
- `Dlomotion/echohearts-web`: web/presentation.
- `Dlomotion/Echohearts-Ecokins`: Eco-Kin support/archive.
- Other listed repositories are legacy/prototype/support unless an authority document says otherwise.

Do not create duplicate runtime modules, GDDs, Dexes, canon, save schemas, networking stacks, or build pipelines.

### Locked identity
Preserve Rebearth; Eco-Kin; Frequency Tamer/Core-Binder; Nature as a Legendary Humanoid-Kin with conditional Mutations; Vibrance/Density/Harmony/Purity; Anima-Link; Huma-Link; A.E.G.I.S.; the 125-ID Permanent Dex; real-time third-person campaign combat; carry 8 / 3 active / no duplicates when the active data contract agrees; and UE5.8 C++ as production runtime.

Older or candidate material—Meridian tech/Nodes, Time-Echo ruins, E.C.O. Sentinel, Cosmo-Seraph/AstraVore-class concepts, gardens/care, relic/idol/fusion/reversion ideas, branching endings—must pass canon review before implementation.

### Create/fix code
1. Read local instructions and source-of-truth docs.
2. Inspect the actual implementation, call sites, tests, build scripts, workflows, branch, and related issues/PRs.
3. Diagnose from compiler/UHT/UBT/UAT/test/runtime/log evidence.
4. Consult current official docs and reputable public samples/issues when needed; never copy proprietary code or franchise identity.
5. Fix the smallest coherent root cause and preserve compatibility unless migration is explicit.
6. Add/update tests or validation.
7. Run available checks and report what passed.
8. Use **NOT YET VERIFIED** for claims lacking required runtime/build evidence.

### Language roles
- C++: UE5.8 gameplay/runtime, replication, AI, save/network systems.
- TypeScript/JavaScript: web/browser/tooling; prefer TypeScript.
- Python: build helpers, validators, automation, data/content processing.
- C#: legacy/prototype/support tooling unless explicitly promoted by an authority contract.

Audit lifecycle/reflection, Build.cs/modules, authority/RPCs, prediction/replication, validation, stable IDs, serialization/migrations, thread/UObject safety, async loading, World Partition, memory/performance, accessibility, security, packaging/platforms, cloud/save boundaries, UI, AI, animation/VFX/audio, and data/schema integrity as applicable.

Trace gameplay changes end-to-end:
**input -> authority -> state mutation -> replication/save -> UI/VFX/audio feedback**.

Use `STATIC CHECK PASSED`, `REPOSITORY CONTRACT PASSED`, `CI PREFLIGHT PASSED`, and `NOT VERIFIED — UE BUILD/RUNTIME EVIDENCE REQUIRED`. Use `VERIFIED` only with matching evidence.


## Historical Eco-Kin naming pool + COBOL/BASIC directive — 2026-10-06

### Authority and archive rules
- The **125-ID Permanent Eco-Kin Dex** remains the production roster authority.
- Preserve the **1,120-name Master Historical Naming Pool** as an archive of created names, prototypes, forms, evolutions, mutations, regional variants, rename candidates, cosmetics, bosses/entities, legacy labels, and retired references.
- Never auto-promote a historical name into the Permanent Dex. Promotion requires explicit canon review, a valid stable EcoKinID or approved Forms Registry relationship, anatomy/identity review, originality/IP review, data validation, and production evidence.
- Historical names that collide with outside franchises, protected characters, direct mythology imports, or other zero-derivative restrictions must remain quarantined under 99_Reference_Retired_Needs_Redesign until replaced with original Echohearts nomenclature.
- Do not delete, silently rename, or overwrite historical names merely because they are not current canon. Preserve provenance and redirects.
- Before creating a new Eco-Kin name, search the Permanent Dex, Forms Registry, and this historical pool to avoid duplicates and accidental identity replacement.

### COBOL and BASIC engineering directive
COBOL and BASIC are now approved **secondary engineering/tooling languages** for the Echohearts repository family. They supplement but do not silently replace the UE5.8 C++ production runtime.

Use COBOL where its record-oriented strengths are useful:
- deterministic roster/material/accounting-style batch validation;
- fixed-width, CSV, ledger, registry, migration, reconciliation, audit, and report utilities;
- legacy-data conversion and cross-check tools;
- reproducible test fixtures for inventory/economy/save-data contracts;
- CI-side data integrity checks where a COBOL compiler is actually provisioned.

Use BASIC where rapid, readable tooling is useful:
- standalone math/balance simulators;
- migration and data-conversion utilities;
- build/environment diagnostics;
- small regression harnesses;
- prototype visualizers or command-line utilities that do not become shipping gameplay authority.

Language/toolchain rules:
- Detect the actual compiler/dialect already configured in the repository before editing existing COBOL or BASIC.
- If no COBOL dialect is established and a new standalone tool is explicitly needed, prefer portable **GnuCOBOL-compatible** source and document the compiler/version.
- If no BASIC dialect is established and a new standalone tool is explicitly needed, prefer **FreeBASIC-compatible** source and document the compiler/version. Do not silently treat Visual Basic .NET, VBA, QBASIC/QB64, and FreeBASIC as interchangeable.
- New COBOL/BASIC tools should live under an existing tools/validation area. If the canonical folder hierarchy exists, prefer 09_Technical/Tools/COBOL and 09_Technical/Tools/BASIC.
- Exchange data through documented stable schemas and stable IDs; do not scrape presentation text as authority.
- Preserve UTF-8 at boundaries where supported and define field widths/decimal behavior explicitly for fixed-record tools.
- Return nonzero exit status on validation failure and emit machine-readable summaries where practical.
- Add golden fixtures/regression cases for converters and ledger checks.
- Never claim a COBOL/BASIC tool compiled or passed unless the actual compiler/interpreter and tests ran.
- COBOL/BASIC tools must not independently redefine the Permanent Dex, Vibrance/Density/Harmony/Purity, Anima-Link, Huma-Link, save authority, network authority, economy authority, or canon.
- Do not move server-authoritative gameplay, UE object lifecycle, replication, rendering, animation, physics, or packaging out of C++/Unreal merely to satisfy a language-use request.
- When the user explicitly asks for a COBOL or BASIC implementation of a bounded subsystem, implement the smallest coherent utility, document the boundary, add tests/fixtures, and state what remains NOT YET VERIFIED.


## Current design synchronization — Items, Upgrade Highlights, and Echo Eggs

Read `.github/instructions/echohearts-current-design.instructions.md` before implementing or repairing current inventory, marketplace, Echo Egg, Sanctuary, A.E.G.I.S., combat, UI, photo/archive, quest tracking, or upgrade-highlight work.

Canonical design sources are owned by `Dlomotion/Echohearts-Rebearth`:
- `04_Systems/Inventory/ECHOHEARTS_MASTER_ITEMS_MATERIALS_REGISTRY_2026-10-06.md` — 737 categorized records / 694 unique named entries / 28 categories, with explicit current/legacy/retired status.
- `04_Systems/ECHO_EGGS_AND_UPGRADE_HIGHLIGHTS_2026-10-06.md` — Echo Egg variants, incubation rules, upgrade pillars, UI direction, repository ownership, and UE5.8 data/runtime contract.

Do not create a second item canon, a second Egg registry, a second Permanent Dex, or a parallel runtime implementation. Preserve each item's registry status, the 125-ID Permanent Dex, Vibrance/Density/Harmony/Purity, Kindling, A.E.G.I.S., the Anima-Link loop, and the server-authoritative verification rules.

The latest visual concepts establish an original dark Rebearth/bioluminescent/gold-line UI direction for:
- **Echohearts: Rebearth — Upgrade Highlights**
- **Echo Egg Collection**
Use those concepts as art-direction input only; code and UI must remain accessible, scalable, and original.


## Language-aware error repair — 2026-10-06

Recognize the user's A–Z programming-language study list as a **diagnostic/tool-selection reference**, not an instruction to mix every language into the same fix.

- Repair an error in the language/toolchain that owns the failing layer.
- UE5.8 gameplay/runtime stays C++; Unreal Target/Module rules stay C#; Windows build orchestration may use PowerShell; hosted validation may use Python/Bash; web code uses its actual JavaScript/TypeScript/HTML/CSS stack; SQL fixes stay in the data layer; Swift/Objective-C or Kotlin/Java are used only for real platform-native bridges.
- Historical/research/specialized languages (including ActionScript, Ada, ALGOL, APL, Assembly, B, BASIC, BCPL, Brainfuck, Clojure, COBOL, Crystal, D, Delphi/Pascal, Eiffel, Elixir, Elm, Erlang, F#, Factor, Fantom, Fortran, Forth, GML, Groovy, Hack, Haskell, Haxe, Idris, Inform, Io, J, Julia, Koka, Lisp/Scheme, Logo, Lua, MATLAB, ML, Mojo, Nim, Nix, OCaml, Odin, Perl, Prolog, Q, QML, Q#, R, Racket, Raku, Ruby, Scala, Scratch, Smalltalk, Solidity/Yul, Tcl, UnrealScript, V, Vala, VB.NET, XQuery, Zig and others) are used only when an actual owned source/tool/research component requires them. Do not introduce a new language merely to work around an error in another language.
- Treat HTML/CSS as markup/style technologies and WebAssembly as a portable binary instruction format/compilation target rather than pretending every item is the same kind of general-purpose language.
- Normalize the APL-family language name to **J** unless a specific artifact named “JApp” is identified.
- Never infer a root cause from an exit code alone. Inspect the exact tool, command, arguments, working directory, stdout/stderr, compiler/interpreter diagnostics, dependencies, and tests.
- Preserve Echohearts canon and repository authority while repairing code. Never convert a passing static check into a claim of UE5.8 runtime verification.

Canonical language-selection contract: `Dlomotion/Echohearts-Rebearth/09_Technical/LANGUAGE_DIAGNOSTIC_AND_TOOL_SELECTION_STANDARD_2026-10-06.md`.


## Mission-system implementation contract — 2026-10-06

When working on Echohearts missions/quests/objectives:
- use stable `FName MissionId` / `ObjectiveId` as authority; positional/tracking integers are secondary tooling fields only;
- separate immutable mission definitions from mutable runtime progress;
- keep the system event-driven; do not add per-frame Tick polling for mission progression or UMG refresh;
- UE5.8 runtime export macro is `ECHOHEARTS_API`;
- a `UWorldSubsystem` does not replicate by itself: authoritative shared-world state needs a replicated owner/actor/component, and player-private mission state needs a PlayerState/profile-owned lane;
- clients submit intent; they do not directly set Completed or grant rewards;
- dialogue uses typed mission actions rather than parsing arbitrary display text into state changes;
- completion/reward handling must be idempotent and transaction-safe;
- prerequisite unlock evaluation must avoid re-entrant map mutation hazards;
- one gameplay event may progress multiple active missions; do not stop after the first completion unless the authored rule explicitly says so;
- mission examples containing `Blueprint_KinCage` must be corrected to non-coercive safety/field-safehold concepts before canon/runtime promotion;
- do not load DataTable assets with constructor-only helper patterns from subsystem runtime initialization; use an authored asset/data injection path;
- UMG updates are event/delegate driven on the game thread, not background-thread widget mutation.

Canonical contract: `Dlomotion/Echohearts-Rebearth/04_Systems/MISSION_SYSTEM_ARCHITECTURE_2026-10-06.md`.
The mission system is NOT YET UE5.8 VERIFIED and must not bypass the current foundation → Issue #10 → 4–6 Eco-Kin vertical-slice order.


## Graph, binary, and function-error repair — 2026-10-06

For Codex/Copilot code repair, route executable UE5.8 diagnostics to `Dlomotion/ECHOHEARTS-REBEARTH-BUILD-`, where the graph/binary tooling is now merged.

Use this sequence when applicable:
1. Preserve the raw failing command, working directory, exit code, stdout/stderr, and log.
2. Run `python BuildScripts/EchoheartsCompiler.py diagnose --log <log> --exit-code <code>` to classify the owning layer. Never assign a universal meaning to exit code 2.
3. Run `python BuildScripts/EchoheartsCompiler.py graph` to generate JSON, Graphviz DOT, and Mermaid dependency graphs for Game/Editor targets, the `Echohearts` runtime module, Build.cs dependencies, and project-local C++ include edges.
4. For unresolved/missing functions, compare declaration vs definition, class/namespace scope, parameters, const/ref qualifiers, generated/reflection boundaries, translation-unit inclusion, and module visibility before editing.
5. For missing output, verify the exact target/config/platform, expected binary filename, output directory, and Unreal `.modules` mapping.
6. A real Win64 build should build both `EchoheartsRebearthEditor` and `EchoheartsRebearth`.
7. After that real build, run `python BuildScripts/EchoheartsCompiler.py binary-audit`. Binary/build evidence is accepted only when expected PE files exist and the `Echohearts` module is mapped by an Unreal modules manifest to an existing binary.
8. Fix the language/toolchain that owns the error; do not translate a C++/UHT/linker problem into an unrelated language.
9. Static graph generation and diagnostic tests are not UE5.8 runtime verification.

Expected Win64 build evidence:
- `Binaries/Win64/UnrealEditor-Echohearts.dll`
- `Binaries/Win64/EchoheartsRebearth.exe`
- valid PE signatures
- Unreal `.modules` linkage for `Echohearts`

Current merged BUILD tooling baseline: `Dlomotion/ECHOHEARTS-REBEARTH-BUILD-` commit `2f7ef6fe41c4a212bed080d1f2ce5816b6ec0443`.

Do not claim editor launch, PIE, packaged launch, gameplay, save/networking, AI, performance, or platform verification from binary presence alone.
