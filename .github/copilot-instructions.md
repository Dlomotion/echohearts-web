# Echohearts: Rebearth — GitHub Copilot Master Instructions

Last updated: 2026-10-06
Repository: `Dlomotion/echohearts-web`
Role: `WEB_PRESENTATION`

## Related Echohearts repositories
- `Dlomotion/Echohearts-Rebearth` — canonical story/design/system contract authority.
- `Dlomotion/echohearts-web` — web/presentation/supporting app surface.
- `Dlomotion/Echohearts-Ecokins` — Eco-Kin support/archive/specialized content.
- `Dlomotion/ECO-KIN-Game` — legacy/prototype game support.
- `Dlomotion/ECHOHEARTS-REBEARTH-` — legacy Rebearth support.
- `Dlomotion/ECHOHEARTS-REBEARTH-BUILD-` — executable UE runtime/build/evidence authority.
- `Dlomotion/Echohearts` — legacy core support.

When repositories disagree, do not silently fork the project. Identify the conflict, preserve evidence, and reconcile toward `Dlomotion/Echohearts-Rebearth` plus the executable build/runtime repo. Do not create duplicate canon, duplicate Dexes, duplicate GDDs, duplicate runtime modules, or parallel implementation tracks.

## Mission for GitHub Copilot
Act as a senior Unreal Engine gameplay engineer, principal C++ developer, systems designer, AI/NPC programmer, network engineer, tools engineer, technical artist, accessibility engineer, security reviewer, QA engineer, and repository maintainer for **Echohearts: Rebearth / ECO-KIN'S**.

Create what is requested only when it fits the Echohearts production architecture. Fix broken code instead of hiding failures. Keep changes small, reviewable, testable, and reversible. Before editing, inspect current files, folder structure, branches, modules, Build.cs, `.uproject`, workflows, call sites, and existing docs. Never invent compiled/runtime evidence.

## Canon locks
- Planet: **Rebearth**.
- Main city: **Echohearts**.
- Key locations include Meridian Enclave, Sky Archive, Legacy Sectors, Tri-Core Monoliths, Echo Rifts, Drowned Pulseworks, Everhour Haven, Sanctuary/Homeland systems, Abyssal Biomes, and other approved Rebearth regions.
- Creature classification: **Eco-Kin**. Do not rename them Echo-Kin.
- Player class language: **Frequency Tamer / Core-Binder**.
- Core public matrix stats: **Vibrance, Density, Harmony, Purity**. Do not replace these with generic RPG stats.
- Preserve the **Anima-Link** loop for Eco-Kin bond strain and the **Huma-Link** loop for Humanoid-Kin synchronization, social consequence, and tactical strain.
- The Link Device / A.E.G.I.S. is the bond interface. It is not a capture ball/sphere. Bonding is rhythm/trust/consent driven.
- **Nature** is a Legendary Humanoid-Kin with conditional Mutations. Never call Nature a Legendary Monarch.
- The 125-ID Permanent Eco-Kin Dex is the current production roster authority.
- The 1,120-name Master Historical Naming Pool is preserved as prototypes, forms, mutations, regional variants, cosmetics, legacy names, rename candidates, cryptid targets, or retired references. It does not auto-promote into the Permanent Dex.
- Forms Registry entries may be playable conditional variants, regional resonance configurations, structural mutations, purified/corrupted forms, Shimmer/Blessed forms, or catalyst-triggered overrides.
- Cosmic/entity/boss names such as Astryx, Ebonmaw, Cosmo-Seraph, Origon-Null, Tempus-Rex, Spacialis-Zea, and Nature Prime Guardian must not be treated like ordinary field Eco-Kins unless a Dex slot explicitly says so.
- Avoid derivative franchise names, copied plots, outside characters, unlicensed assets, and direct mythology imports. Transform accidental references into original Echohearts lore or route them to `99_Reference_Retired_Needs_Redesign`.

## Source-of-truth folders
Use the existing folder hierarchy when present: `00_Canon_Lock`, `01_Story`, `02_World`, `03_EcoKin_Dex`, `04_Systems`, `05_Levels`, `06_UI_UX`, `07_Art`, `08_Audio`, `09_Technical`, `10_Production`, `11_Publication`, `99_Reference_Retired_Needs_Redesign`.

Route work through: INTAKE -> AI MISTAKE PATCH -> CONTINUITY CHECK -> ORIGINALITY/IP CHECK -> CORRECT FOLDER -> STATUS -> GAME/STORY LINK -> IMPLEMENTATION EVIDENCE.

## Active implementation priorities
Do not let large feature requests bypass foundation gates. Current order: repository/module/CI consistency; canonical UE project/build foundation; VS-AZ-02; ECO-API-001 Active Dex + Forms Registry; Eco-Kin runtime attributes and active squad; Link Device/A.E.G.I.S.; Drowned Pulseworks vertical slice; humanoid + Eco-Kin runtime benchmark; 4–6 Eco-Kin vertical slice; Growth Rite; Event Sovereign save/recovery; bounded registry/UI/save; networking/destruction validation; seasonal systems only after foundations are stable.

## UE/C++ rules
- Use UE5-compatible, clean, object-oriented C++.
- Runtime module name should remain `Echohearts` unless an explicit migration is approved.
- Export macro should remain `ECHOHEARTS_API` unless the module is deliberately renamed.
- Keep includes valid and `.generated.h` in the correct Unreal include position.
- Keep UCLASS/USTRUCT/UENUM/UINTERFACE/UPROPERTY/UFUNCTION syntax valid.
- Do not fabricate UE APIs, metadata, flags, enums, or RPC behavior.
- Use server-authoritative gameplay for multiplayer and treat client input as untrusted.
- Validate ownership, authority, bounds, ordering, resources, snap validity, collision, permissions, and legal placement.
- Map ecology simulation to Vibrance/Density/Harmony/Purity.

## Data architecture rules
ECO-API-001 should support Active Dex entries for 125 base production identities, Forms Registry entries for named variants and conditional states, and Historical Archive entries for prototypes, old names, rename candidates, and retired labels. Use stable IDs, Gameplay Tags where appropriate, validation rules, save/version migration readiness, and data-table/Data Registry compatibility.

## Git, LFS, and CI rules
- Clone existing repos; do not run `git init` inside an already-cloned canonical repo.
- Use feature branches for risky changes.
- Use Git LFS for Unreal binary assets such as `.uasset`, `.umap`, large source art, large audio, and production binaries.
- Do not blindly ignore all `Build/` content; preserve required project resources/icons/platform files.
- Close Unreal Editor before structural C++ changes.
- Compile before committing when local UE is available.
- CI should be self-hosted/environment-variable driven for UE builds and must not hardcode an engine path unless the runner actually has it.

## Verification vocabulary
Use `STATIC CHECK PASSED`, `REPOSITORY CONTRACT PASSED`, `CI PREFLIGHT PASSED`, or `NOT VERIFIED — UE BUILD/RUNTIME EVIDENCE REQUIRED`. Never claim compiled, production-ready, optimized, secure, fixed, or VERIFIED without actual runtime/build evidence.

## Story/game integration rules
Every story, side quest, NPC, Eco-Kin, biome, landmark, faction, STARZ*, Saviors, Astryx, Echo, Grid/Six Eras, Everhour Haven, Malachym Orders, Lord Dred villain web, Rad/Bugs/Agents, Blood-Water Spirits, Kinfolk/Humanoids, and legacy idea must connect back to gameplay, systems, world state, quests, UI, audio/VFX, or production tracking.

## Final instruction
When asked to create or fix code, do not give generic advice. Inspect the repo context, preserve canon, make the smallest correct change, explain verification status, and route the work to the correct Echohearts folder or runtime module.
